			<h2>"Turn what is black and white into colour"</h2>
			<p>
				Over ten years ago I had a short fleeting dream of a flash of
				colour, accompanied by the impression: ‘turn what is black and
				white into colour’. Up until this point I had been teaching the
				Bible through handing people bits of paper with words on them.
				But I had felt frustrated: something was missing. I knew this
				wasn’t the primary way people learned.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="aside">
			<h2>Learning through play</h2>
			<p>
				I wanted people to understand how well the library of books that
				we have come to call the Bible all fit together; to discover how
				all the biblical places relate to each other by looking at maps;
				to appreciate the dynamic impact of the rise and fall of
				dominant empires in the ancient world. In other words, I wanted
				people to feel the biblical narrative as one integrated,
				colourful whole, not just read bits of it. And I knew that the
				best way for people to absorb all of these elements, and more,
				was not by reading pieces of paper, but was through playing
				games, as we learn best through play.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="aside">
			<h2>“I can help you”</h2>
			<p>
				Sarah (Dickins) a product designer, working for a multinational
				at the time, saw my initial efforts: book cards on colourful
				pieces of paper; blue and green material for maps; and careful
				illustrations which Robyn, my friend who is an artist, had
				generously designed for every book in the Bible. From then on,
				Sarah faithfully partnered with me in transforming this fleeting
				dream into a viable product.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="aside">
			<h2>“Let’s capture the places through using satellite imagery”</h2>
			<p>
				After discussing for so long what material to use for the maps,
				Sarah’s idea to print photographs of the topography onto boards
				using satellite imagery brought together the desire to see the
				places on maps, with a board game feel.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="aside">
			<h2>“What is missing is the people: we need to see the people“</h2>
			<p>
				‘What is missing is the people: we need to see the people’.
				Sarah highlighted. So, we asked Zac (Crawley of Candour
				Creative) and Jon (Tyrell) if they would be able to travel to
				Israel and Palestine and take 70 photos for our people cards.
				Navigating adventures on the way, they returned with photos
				beautifully capturing the gist of the humanity of the biblical
				narrative. And if you look carefully – you can spot their faces
				amongst the 70!
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="aside">
			<h2>“You need to film on location“</h2>
			<p>
				My brother (who lives in China, but who had briefly returned to
				the UK) said, having taken one look at the new Alpha videos. We
				had been wrestling with whether I needed to be in the product at
				all. Could people simply buy a box and learn as community
				together without my input? But when my brother spoke, I knew
				that, at the very least, for visual kinaesthetic learners simply
				seeing the landscape of Israel would aid their learning. So,
				Chris and I travelled together with Daniel (Krenzer) to film on
				location in Israel and Rome; and then Chris and I travelled
				together with our editor Freddie (Reed) to complete the filming
				in Israel (2019). During this trip, Freddie also took some
				extraordinary still photography, one image of which is now on
				the Biblios box.

			<h2>
				“Would you be prepared to train someone up to teach Biblios?“
			</h2>
			<p>
				I had been teaching Biblios at Release Academy in Bristol for
				the previous two years. Release Academy is a Bethel ‘school of
				supernatural ministry’ hosted by Love Bristol community in
				Stokes Croft. This was the final piece in the jigsaw puzzle: I
				could test and see if anyone could facilitate Biblios, using the
				box and the videos. Sue not only fulfilled this role
				beautifully, but she also came up with such good ideas for games
				that they are now included in the course.
			</p>

		<div class="aside">
			<h2>“Everyone is learner, everyone is a contributor“</h2>
			<p>
				This is the spirit and process of Biblios. I believe from the
				bottom of my heart, that not only can everyone learn the Bible,
				but also everyone can host the learning of the Bible. Biblios
				helps facilitate this transition in our thinking. I have had the
				immense privilege of working with a community of people who are
				a lot more talented than me. Led, at every step, and provided
				for, at every level, by the prompting of the Spirit of God, I
				have seen a fleeting impression become a reality. Biblios is
				literally a dream come true.
